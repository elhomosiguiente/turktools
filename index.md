**Turktools** are a set of free, open-source tools that aid in the construction of linguistic surveys for [Amazon's Mechanical Turk](http://mturk.com). The tools allow for the creation of a wide range of linguistic tasks, including linguistic grammaticality surveys, sentence completion tasks, and picture-matching tasks. Our tools further help streamline the design of such experiments and assist in the extraction and analysis of the resulting data.

## Features

* Simplifies the **full workflow** for Turk-style experiment construction: randomized counterbalanced lists, local experiment simulation, and results in a format optimized for analysis
* **Template skeletons** which maximizes template reusability
* **Cross-platform** (Windows, Mac, and Linux), requiring only Python (2.6 or 2.7)
* **Easy-to-use tools** designed for non-programmers
* Experiments can be used **without Mechanical Turk**, with the use of [turkserver](http://turktools.net/use/server.html)
